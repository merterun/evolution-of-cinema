Welcome to this exciting project. We'll be analyzing the trends of the greatest movies over the years.

This project is an in-depth analysis of the movie industry, using data from the IMDB. We will be looking at the top rated movies by genre, average runtime over the years, gross total by year, and predictions for the average gross total in the future. We'll also be diving into the world of movie-making and exploring some interesting facts and figures that you might not have known.
